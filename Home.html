    <h2>Why we need Inspirational Stories and Quotes?</h2>

    <p>Motivational stories have the ability to lift us up, make us smile, encourage, motivate, and teach us valuable life lessons. Here are some motivating stories that will hopefully help you spark that motivational feeling. They give us an empowering sense of hope, that if ‘he/she’ can do it, so can I.
	</p>
    <p>Throughout history, people have used inspirational stories to teach, encourage, and inspire in hopes that the listener will use it as a stepping stone and as an example to live a better life. Some will make you think, some will make you cry. Hopefully, some will give you that motivation to go for your dreams.
    </p>
	<p>
	The important thing to remember when reading these inspiring stories is that when you get that feeling of motivation, where you want to do something, do something. Nothing is more of a waste than to be inspired and motivated and not take any action. Your life will only change as a result of taking focused action. An inspirational story is nothing if it doesn’t cause you to do something or at least make you believe in yourself a bit more. Hopefully, these inspiring stories will change your life in some way.
